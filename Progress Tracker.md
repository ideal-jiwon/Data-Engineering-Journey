1. Build a real foundation
 
**SQL**
- Window Functions
- Joins at Scale
- Writing queries that power pipelines

	- Jan, 10 2026 : I started working on improving SQL from Jan03 
	- Jan, 9 2026 : I Completed "https://www.sqlclimber.com/assignments/beginner"
 	- Jan, 18 2026 : I starting working on "https://www.sqlclimber.com/assignments/elementary"	 


**Python**
- The glue of data engineering
-- Orchestrating pipelines
-- Working with APIs
-- Libraries that actually move data (pandas, pyarrow, requests)

**Data Modelling**
- Fact tables vs dimensions
- Dimension data modelling
- Designing datasets for analytics, not just storage
- Modelling unstructured data


2. Understand how data works at scale

**Distributed compute**
- Spark, BigQuery, Snowflake
- Why parallel processing exists
- When things break

**Processing data**
- Batch vs Streaming
- Transforming data without killing performance

3. Building Pipelines
- Designing pipelines that scale
- Parallel processing instead of sequential scripts
- Thinking in systems, not scripts
Communication
- Translating requirements from stakeholders
- Understanding what the business actually needs
- Building the right pipeline, not the most complex one

4. Build something real
- Build a tool someone actually uses
- Even if it is simple
- Examples : 
-- A small internal data pipeline
-- A reporting system powered by SQL + Python
-- A data model that fixes broken reporting
-- Anything that solves a real problem

**Complex does not matter, Usage does

5. Show your work
- Demo what you built
- Explain the impact
- Who uses it?
- What problem does it solve?
- Why does it matter?

*Say yes early*
Especially at the beginning
- Take responsibility
- Take ownership
- Take uncomfortable projects
Yes, it adds stress
Yes, it is worth it

That's how I move from learning to engineering
